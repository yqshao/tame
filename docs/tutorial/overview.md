# Overview

In TAME, analysis is defined through `FrameArray` - numpy-array-like objects
which are updated when the program goes through the trajectories - and their
time correlations.

The following set of tutorials walks you through how different structural and
dynamic properties can be defined from those objects, along with some example
analysis that can be represented.
