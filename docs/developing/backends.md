# Operations

TAME takes advantage of established libraries for heavy numerical tasks.
Currently, the computations are performed with the Numpy library. Other
computation backends might be implemented in hte future.

### Basic functions

The below functions are basic mathematical operations that are available between
(aliased as `tm` below), 

| operator | function     | description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
|          | `tm.plus`    |             |
|          | `tm.minus`   |             |
|          | `tm.product` |             |
