# TAME Recipes 

In TAME, recipes are scripts for specific properties. All recipes can be
accessed from the `tame` command line tool. Most recipes are arranged in a
hierarchical structure as `tame {group} {method}`.

Below is a list of method groups implemented in TAME. 

- `diff`: diffusion coefficient calculations
- `cond`: conductivity calculations
- `struct`: structural properties

Usage and options of recipes can be accessed from `tame {group} -p` or `tame
{group} {method} -h`. This section contains more detailed discussion about the
implementation or the algorithm.
